.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
A mixer mixes together attached streams into a single buffer.
In the process, it converts channel configurations, sample frequencies
and audio depths of the attached sample instances and audio streams
accordingly.
You can control the quality of this conversion using
ALLEGRO_MIXER_QUALITY.
.PP
When going from mono to stereo (and above), the mixer reduces the volume
of both channels by \f[C]sqrt(2)\f[].
When going from stereo (and above) to mono, the mixer reduces the volume
of the left and right channels by \f[C]sqrt(2)\f[] before adding them to
the center channel (if present).
